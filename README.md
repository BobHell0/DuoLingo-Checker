# DuoLingo-Checker

A good friend of mine asked for me to make a productivity app which checked if
he had completed his personal daily requirement of being on Duolingo for at least
ten (10) minutes. Until this check passed, he should not be able to access Tik Tok.

## General Requirement

Has (insert friend name here) been on Duolingo for ten minutes today?
Yes --> he is allowed to open and use Tik Tok
No --> don't let him open Tik Tok
